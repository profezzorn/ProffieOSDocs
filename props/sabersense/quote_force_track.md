# Quote, Force Effect and Track Players

Built into the Sabersense button system is the ability to play music tracks with the blade off, force effects with the blade on and character quotes with the blade off or on.
The controls are as follows:

## Blade Off

- Play Character Quote - Fast double-click POWER, hilt pointing up, plays sequentially.
  
- Play Music Track - Fast double-click POWER, pointing down.

## Blade On

- Play Character Quote - Fast double-click POWER, hilt pointing up, plays sequentially.
  
- Force Effect - Fast double-click POWER, hilt pointing down, plays randomly.

You can reverse the up/down orientations by adding the following define to the CONFIG_TOP section of your config:

`#define SABERSENSE_FLIP_AUDIO_PLAYERS`
