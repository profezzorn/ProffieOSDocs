# Introducing the Sabersense Button System

## Overview
Built on Matthew McGeary’s SA22C setup, the Sabersense Prop File has been designed with simplicity in mind. It provides a saber control system that is intuitive, easy to use
and consistent in terms of ‘rules’. It doesn’t require a ‘knack’ to access certain features, and tricky combinations like holding a button while simultaneously twisting or making other active gestures have been mostly removed. More complex features like Battle Mode are also not included.

## Harmonized One-Button and Two-Button Controls
Basic features like normal ignition, track playing, force effects, mute ignition, quotes etc. all have the same button controls on both one-button and two-button setups. This means users with large hilt collections which include one-button and two-button sabers don’t need to remember different sets of controls for these core features.

## Consistent ‘Rules’
This again means the user has less to remember. For example, one click of POWER with blade off ALWAYS lights the blade - short click for normal, long click for muted; double click POWER ALWAYS plays a sound effect - track with blade off, character quote or force effect with blade on pointed up/down respectively. This is all intended to make it easier for the user to remember the various controls.

## Comprehensive Font Navigation 
One-button and two-button setups both allow users to move forwards or backwards one font at a time, or to skip to first font, last font or middle font. Two-button setups include additional navigation features which allow the user to skip forwards or backwards five and ten fonts at a time.

## Blade ID Scanning On Demand
This allows users to run blade ID with a button press, removing the need for continuous automatic scanning. More details can be found here: https://pod.hubbe.net/props/sabersense/blade_id

## Manual Array Selection
This allows users to cycle through multiple blade arrays manually. This system can be implemented in many different ways. See the Array Selector page for more details. More details can be found here: https://pod.hubbe.net/props/sabersense/array_selector

## Button ‘Clicker’
For hilts that have buttons with poor tactile feedback (KR’s Scavenger for instance, with the emitter wheel button setup), the system can be set to play custom click sounds to accompany button presses, aiding in system navigation.

## System Reset Feature
As users make changes to things like blade colour, volume and which font they last used, these changes are stored in system save files on the SD card. The Sabersense Button System includes the ability to completely reset the system and 'restore factory defaults' by deleting these save files simply with a button press.

## Compatibility
The Sabersense Button System has been written for, and is included with, ProffieOS 8.x or later. However it is also fully backwards compatible with ProffieOS 7.x as standard, with all the same features.

## Free Sound Files
The Sabersense Prop File uses certain sound files to aid feature navigation. Although not necessary for the system to work, these files are available as a free download from the Sabersense website. Visit www.sabersense.co.uk and navigate to *downloads*.
